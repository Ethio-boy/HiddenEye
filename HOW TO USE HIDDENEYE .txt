[ ---- STEPS TO LAUNCH AN ATTACK WITH HIDDENEYE TOOL ---- ]



A) STARTING WITH SCRIPT LAUNCH.

- Just after being launched for the first time script will install NGROK , which is necessary to install.

- After completing installation of NGROK.

- Script will ask you about the responsibility of using the tool.
- Just press ' y ' and hit Enter, if you are ready to follow those words. Unless press 'n' to exit .

- Now the main menu of script should be launched.

{ IT WILL BE BETTER IF YOU JUST ZOOM-OUT, YOU CAN ZOOM-IN/ ZOOM-OUT ANYTIME , WHENEVER YOU FIND UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE TEXT }


- NOW You will get  MAIN MENU .

- Here are many options to launch different-different phishing attacks.

- JUST CHOOSE YOUR REQUIRED ONE.



B) CHOOSING A ATTACK AND LAUNCHING IT.

- In that main menu, Just choose your Attack. AND type its number and press ENTER.

- Now it will ask to If you wants to add a Keylogger or Not.
 
 {Keylogger is a advanced option, it will help you to get all the keys pressed by the user}
 {Use it only when required , As the browsers can detect the keylogger in many case}
 {SO USE BRAIN TO THINK IF IT SHOULD ADD OR NOT }
 
- Just decide and  press y and hit enter to add keylogger , OR press n and hit Enter to remove it.

- Now the script will ask you for choosing a redirect URL.
  ( Redirect url are that url at which the victim will get redirected after submitting the login and password. )
  ( Its always a wise decision to redirect the user to the original login page )
  
- Now the script will ask you for a choosing a port.
- Just enter and desired port number 
  Ex. 1234 or 4444 or 3232
  whatever you want.
  
- Now script will ask you to select any availbale server to launch the attack worldwide.
  
  (I suggest you to choose serveo , as it also provides the cutomized url)
- choose anyone and type its number and hit enter.
- If you choosed NGROK , the attack will start and will give you a URL.
- But if you choosed SERVEO, then the serveo will aks another option.
- These options are about choosing RANDOM URL or CUSTOM URL.
- Just type the corresponding number and hit Enter.
- Now if you chosen the CUSTOM URL , Then You will be asked to enter a custom link.

{ Remember one thing, creating a good belivable url is always good idea in such phishing attacks , But Serveo will not give you evry URL you Chosen , So choose wisely, Because serveo can detect your custom url as suspicious and will drop it }   

- For example just type : 'login.live.microsoft' and it will give you a link like https://login.live.microsoft.serveo.net.

- NOW THE SCRIPT WILL GIVE YOU THE LINK.
- JUST SEND THIS LINK TO YOUR VICTIM.



C) WHAT IF YOU GET ANY ERROR ??
- Its pretty easy to find solution of any error occured in all the above process.
- Just visit the below address which belongs to official repo of hiddeneye.
  ( https://github.com/darksecdevelopers/hiddeneye/issues )
- At this address just search for what error you got, or simply create a new issue out there if you did not find your solution.

 You will get,
 
- IP ADDRESS
- LOCATION BASED ON IP ADDRESS
- VICTIM DEVICE DETAILS 
- VICTIM USER AGENT
- VICTIM BROWSER
- LOGIN CREDENTIALS
- KEYSTROKES ( If you added keylogger )

E) WHERE YOU WILL GET THESE DETAILS ?

You will get all the details in the same terminal you used to launch the script.

NOTE: DON'T CLOSE THAT TERMINAL, UNLESS THE LINK WILL DIE AND ATTACK WILL STOP AUTOMATICALLY.
      ALSO JUST COPY/PASTE THE CAPTURED DATA IN SEPARATE A SAFE PLACE, AS YOU WILL LOOSE THESE DATA JUST AFTER CLOSING THE TERMINAL.
